World Intact Forest Landscapes Map

Project Summary
The map is a result of a global assessment of intact forest landscapes using circa year 2000 Landsat imagery. 
Intact Forest Landscapes (IFL) defined as unbroken expanses of natural ecosystems in the zone of current forest extent without signs of significant human activity, not fragmented by infrastructure, and at least 50,000 hectares in size. The IFL map shows the boundary between unaltered forest landscapes (where most components, including species and site diversity, dynamics and ecological functions remain intact) and altered or fragmented forests (where some level of timber extraction, species composition change, anthropogenic fragmentation and/or alteration of ecosystem dynamics has taken place) and could be used for assessment of forest intactness, alteration and degradation at the global and regional scales.

This map is prepared by the IFL Mapping Team (Greenpeace, World Resources Institute, Transparent World), with the latest update made for year 2012. IFL maps, monitoring results and publications are available on a dedicated web site (http://www.intactforests.org).

Provided IFL data are available for use for valid scientific, conservation, and educational purposes as long as proper citations are used. We ask that you credit the IFL data as follows:
